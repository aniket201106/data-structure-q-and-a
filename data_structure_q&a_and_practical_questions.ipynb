        "Q1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data so that operations like searching, insertion, and deletion become efficient. They act like containers — for example, lists, dictionaries, or sets — each designed for a specific kind of task. Choosing the right data structure can improve performance and reduce complexity. They are the foundation of any efficient algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
        " - Mutable types can be changed after creation (e.g., list, dict).\n",
        "Example: a = [1, 2]; a[0] = 100 → List changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable types cannot be changed once defined (e.g., str, tuple).\n",
        "Example: s = \"hello\"; s[0] = 'H' → Error occurs.\n",
        "This concept is critical for memory management and thread safety in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -List: Mutable, consumes more memory, slower, can be updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuple: Immutable, faster, memory-efficient, ideal for fixed data.\n",
        "Use tuples when data shouldn't change — like database records or coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Dictionaries in Python store data in key-value pairs using a hash-based structure. Each key is mapped to a\n",
        "specific value, and accessing a value requires knowing the key. This structure allows for fast lookups,\n",
        "additions, and deletions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sets are useful when you want to store unique elements and perform fast membership checks. Unlike lists,\n",
        "sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, making them ideal for operations that involve finding unique\n",
        "items or performing mathematical set operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A string is an immutable sequence of characters, whereas a list is a mutable sequence of any data type.\n",
        "While both support indexing and slicing, strings cannot be changed after creation, but lists can be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be altered after creation. This property ensures that\n",
        "data stored in tuples remains consistent, which is particularly valuable in scenarios where data integrity is\n",
        "crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A hash table maps keys to indexes using a hash function. Python dictionaries are built on hash tables, allowing near-instant access to values via keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -Yes, lists in Python can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other\n",
        "lists, making them flexible for handling complex data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Strings are immutable in Python to enhance performance and security. Since each string operation creates\n",
        "a new object, it prevents unintended modifications, which improves the reliability of the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dictionaries provide constant-time complexity for lookups by key, making them more efficient than lists for\n",
        "tasks that involve frequent data retrieval. Lists, on the other hand, require linear time to search for elements,\n",
        "especially in large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tuples are preferable when data should remain constant, such as in database records, coordinates, or\n",
        "configuration settings. Using tuples ensures that the data cannot be modified, maintaining the integrity of\n",
        "the stored values.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sets in Python automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring that each element is unique. This behavior is\n",
        "useful for operations where only distinct items are required, such as removing duplicates from a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- For lists, the “in” keyword checks if a value exists within the list by scanning each element. For dictionaries, it\n",
        "checks if a key exists directly, providing faster lookup times due to the hash-based structure of dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "- No, elements of a tuple cannot be modified because tuples are immutable. Once created, their contents are\n",
        "fixed, making them suitable for data that should remain unchanged throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary. It is useful for storing hierarchical data, such as\n",
        "a directory of users where each user has their personal data stored as a dictionary of properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), thanks to the hash table\n",
        "structure. This efficiency makes dictionaries ideal for scenarios that require frequent and rapid data retrieval.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lists are preferred when the order of elements matters, or when indexing by position is needed. Unlike\n",
        "dictionaries, which use keys, lists are ordered sequences, making them suitable for tasks that involve sequence manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain a specific sequence for their\n",
        "keys and values. However, this does not affect data retrieval as long as retrieval is done by key, as\n",
        "dictionaries provide direct access to values through hashing.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In a list, data retrieval involves accessing elements by index, which is straightforward but linear in search time if the element’s position is unknown. In contrast, a dictionary allows access to data by key, offering faster retrieval regardless of element count.\n",
